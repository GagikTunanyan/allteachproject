        <p>
            CNC machining is a manufacturing process in which pre-programmed computer software dictates the movement of factory
            tools and machinery. The process can be used to control a range of complex machinery, from grinders and lathes to
            mills and routers. With CNC machining, three-dimensional cutting tasks can be accomplished in a single set of prompts.

            With a numerical control machine, programs are inputted via punch cards. By contrast, the programs for CNC machines
            are fed to computers though small keyboards. CNC programming is retained in a computer’s memory. The code itself is
            written and edited by programmers. Therefore, CNC systems offer far more expansive computational capacity. Best of
            all, CNC systems are by no means static, since newer prompts can be added to pre-existing programs through revised code

            In CNC, machines are operated via numerical control, wherein a software program is designated to control an object.
            The language behind CNC machining is alternately referred to as G-code, and it’s written to control the various
            behaviors of a corresponding machine, such as the speed, feed rate and coordination.
